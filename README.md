Question #1:

You have a group of friends coming to visit Portland, and you want to take them out to eat at a local restaurant. You aren’t sure if any of them have dietary restrictions, but your restaurant choices are as follows:

Screen Door —Vegetarian: No, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
Grassa —Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: Yes
Oven and Shaker —Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes
Verde Cocina —Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: No, Gluten-Free: No
Bamboo Sushi —Vegetarian: Yes, Vegan: Yes, Gluten-Free: Yes
Write a program that asks whether any members of your party are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, to which then displays only the restaurants to which you may take the group.
